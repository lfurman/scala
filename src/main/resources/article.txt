Long ago, when Australia's Dieri aborigines sent women to thrash out grievances with other, sometimes cannibalistic tribes, there was a tacit agreement: It's not OK to shoot the messenger — or boil and eat her.

Without putting the name to it, these societies were practicing an early form of diplomatic immunity — a concept once again in the news after a video surfaced of a Qatari man's Ferrari racing through Beverly Hills and police arrested a Saudi prince who they say attempted to force a female worker to perform oral sex on him at a rented estate in Beverly Glen.

Agreements that provide envoys with safe passage and protection from arrest and prosecution have long been viewed as necessary tools for ensuring smooth international relations.
